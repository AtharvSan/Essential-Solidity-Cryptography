Cryptography is the foundation of blockchains, and Solidity developers need a strong grasp of cryptographic primitives to build secure systems. This subject can feel like magic—powerful, complex, and easy to get wrong. This resource aims to bring clarity by demystifying cryptographic concepts and connecting all the moving parts into a cohesive picture.
