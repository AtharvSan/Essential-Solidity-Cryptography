# Cryptography Cheatsheet

### the story
I wanted to write solidity but didn't knew cryptography. I needed a resource that had short explanations with compilable code for all the essential concepts. Honestly, I had a tough time learning from random places cuz cryptography is damn tricky and its very easy to mess things up. I didn't even knew what to read let alone where to read. So I started with the basics and kept figuring out what I needed to learn next. It was a slow process of exploration, learning and implementation. Along the way not just I took notes, also wrote the code. This is that effort to get every essential concept at one place so you have a great time learning cryptography. I have made the notes short and crisp, and added the code illustrations whereever needed. My fellow learners, you have arrived at the right place and I hope this helps you. Cheers!     - AtharvSan
